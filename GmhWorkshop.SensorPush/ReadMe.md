## SensorPush Generated Client

The [SensorPush](https://www.sensorpush.com/) [Gateway Cloud API](https://www.sensorpush.com/gateway-cloud-api) requires SensorPush sensors paired with the [G1 WiFi Gateway — SensorPush](https://www.sensorpush.com/products/p/g1-gateway). The gateway is not free - but the Cloud API is.

This project holds a client generated with [NSwagStudio by RicoSuter/NSwag Wiki (GitHub)](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/wiki/NSwagStudio).

## SensorPush

2023-07-03 [SensorPush](https://www.sensorpush.com/) makes a very nice line of Temperature/Humidity/Barometric Pressure Sensors, an (optional) dedicated WiFi Gateway for the sensors, iOS and Android apps, Web Interface and an (FREE!) Web API. I admit that I sort of want them to make additional sensors, but I also very much respect doing one thing and doing it very well... I'm a fan!
